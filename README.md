# Vim snippets for Chai

[snipMate](https://github.com/msanders/snipmate.vim) is a great plugin that provides the ability to store and retrieve snippets in a very simple and convenient way.

This repository provides some snipMate snippets for [chai](https://github.com/chaijs/chai), a JavaScript BDD / TDD assertion framework.
